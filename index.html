<p align="left">What is Fiverr?<br>
<br>
Fiverr is a web site that hosts all types of business and non-business services, 
with thousands of what we'll call &quot;micro-pay&quot; entrepreneurs, each touting what 
they can do for you for a tiny five bucks. Everyone starts with the same price - 
5 bucks. Hence, a &quot;Five-er.&quot; A job (a &quot;gig&quot; as they call it) for only five bucks? 
Seriously?<br>
<br>
How can anyone do something that will take time and charge 5 bucks and make any 
substantial money in an endeavor like that? And, how does that help a network 
marketing business?<br>
<br>
Well, welcome to the shrinking world of commerce and the Internet. The short 
answer is Fiverr is not only a valid source of labor at a rock-bottom price, but 
it is an opportunity for all network marketing business owners because it is 
built on the same concept as an online network marketing business - the law of 
large numbers can help you make money if you work it right. Equally as important 
is the opportunity to link and hook up with new business owners you would never 
have met without this platform, and that alone is worth looking at Fiverr as 
more than just a place to spend five dollars.<br>
<br>
To fully get the grasp of Fiverr, we looked at Fiverr from two angles, because 
we've used both sides - as a buyer of services, and as a provider of services. 
This article addresses using Fiver as a buyer.<br>
<br>
First, a quick look at Fiverr the website:<br>
<br>
Who Dreamed Up Fiverr?<br>
<br>
Fiverr is the perfect example of where someone with a brilliant idea meets the 
Internet head-on and creates a winning situation for both buyer and seller. At 
$5 a gig, you certainly can't complain of an expensive experience! Fiverr is a 
pretty simple concept if you can get past the onslaught of advertisements from 
every Fiverr entrepreneur who is offering services. There are some pretty 
amazing statistics about Fiverr:<br>
<br>
Fiverr was founded a mere four years ago by Shai Wininger and Micha Kaufman. A 
blog written by Micha over a year ago, indicated at that time, 1.5 million 
people use Fiverr to buy and sell Gigs and many millions more visit the site 
every month. Fiverr members come from more than 200 countries and sellers offer 
over 1.8 million Gigs in 120 different categories. A Gig is purchased every 6 
seconds. Clearly a year later, those numbers have grown.<br>
<br>
Alexa ranks Fiverr (as of 2/14/15) as the number 349 most popular site globally, 
and number 370 in the United States.<br>
<br>
Fiverr has generated over 3 million &quot;gigs&quot; (the term they use for jobs), When 
you consider many Fiverr sellers make more than just the $5 base (as you rise in 
the number of gigs done, you can charge more) it is clear this is a money making 
machine for not only the founders, but if you are successful, as a seller.<br>

Buying on Fiverr - What Do You Buy, And How Do You Do It?<br>
<br>
Buying on Fiverr is not hard. From the list above, you can see buying something 
in these wide categories is not an issue. For Fiverr buyers, this is a great 
thing - there are so many possible entrepreneurs offering you what you want, it 
is a matter of finding someone that has a sharp advertisement or whose 
description of what and how they'll do what you need is better than most. You'll 
have almost unlimited choices.<br>
<br>
While that can be good, consider this - there are three primary categories that 
Fiverr has put in place when buying a gig. There Fiverr members in a &quot;High 
Rating&quot; category, members in a &quot;Recommended&quot;, category, and finally the &quot;newbies&quot; 
in the &quot;New&quot; category.<br>
<br>
While there certainly has to be a way to categorize those offering services, 
this &quot;class distinction&quot; we almost felt was border-line discriminatory until we 
looked at the sheer numbers of individual gigs being offered. Fiverr had to come 
up with a way to delineate &quot;newbies&quot; vs. more experienced members.<br>
<br>
On the day we were on the site researching Fiverr, when we typed in the phrase 
that starts every single Fiverr gig - &quot;I will&quot;, this was the result:<br>
<br>
High Rating - All Categories - 63,741 Recommended - 215,861 New - 52,731.<br>
<br>
That is a total of 332,333 individual gig choices! When you consider that each 
web page you can see when you get results is usually 6-10 gigs on a screen (taking 
into account the size of some screens are small, some are large), at 10 gig 
views a screen, it would take you 33,234 screen scrolls to see all the 
alternatives! At say, 10 seconds per screen to see if any value was perceived, 
that would be 543 hours, or a bit over 3 weeks to see all the choices! Clearly, 
you will have no problem picking from such a large universe of sellers.<br>
<br>
The primary hurdle you will have as a Fiverr buyer will be to pick the best 
qualified seller out of this immense sea of Fiverr members. It is not as 
daunting as it sounds. You'll have to scan just a handful of sellers to 
understand what to look for in an experienced seller. Do they have a video? What 
is their turn around time? How are they ranked and do they have positive 
testimonials? After several minutes, you'll get a feel for what to look for.<br>
<br>
When we purchased gigs, we sometimes spent more than just the $5. Why is that? 
Well, technically, that is all we were required to pay. However, the jobs that 
were done for us were done quickly, efficiently and we paid extra to have that 
happen - instead of a 3 day turnaround, we chose to pay another $5 for a one-day 
turnaround. In one case, we wanted some &quot;bells and whistles&quot;, so we dropped 
another $10 for the gig. Those extra bells and whistles are offered through only 
the recommended and highly ranked sellers.<br>
<br>
NOTE: When you consider that our average ticket was $10, and there have been 
over 3 million gigs completed, that equals 15 million in revenue - pretty solid! 
In reality, it's pretty certain there a a lot of sellers on Fiverr who routinely 
get much more than $5, so you have to conclude Fiverr has created a very 
profitable niche indeed. This solid financial performance we think bodes wll for 
Fiverr continuing as a major player in this growing market of &quot;subcontractors.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once you find a Fiverr provider you like, you simply send a message by email 
through Fiverr, or just pull the trigger based on their description and make a 
purchase for $5. The give and take and communication on Fiverr between buyer and 
seller is very fluid and similar to any good transaction-driven site, so we've 
never found an issue when ordering, adding extras to a gig, and finishing the 
transaction. You can then offer &quot;tips&quot; if the project was good, and also 
testimonials can be left. In that regard, it is not unlike an E-Bay environment 
- a buying community with posted results<br>
<br>
Some buying tips: You can look at all the categories from &quot;high ratings&quot; to &quot;new&quot;, 
and you can see the number of gigs processed and comments and rankings just as 
on eBay, or Elance, or any number of internet sites where services are offered. 
Go with the experience of the person, and let your instinct guide you. Ask 
questions through Fiverr to the seller and your buying experience should be a 
good one.<br>
<br>
Now one angle that is we do want to emphasize - there are network marketing 
services that are valuable that can be purchased on Fiverr. You can purchase 
back links, you can have link wheels constructed, you can have blog content 
written, you can have SEO keyword phrases researched, you can have video scripts 
build, you can have videos made, in short, there are valuable network marketing 
&quot;nuts and bolts&quot; that can be purchased from the Fiverr members that can really 
help your network marketing business.<br>
<br>
Just do your due diligence and shop intelligently. Ask questions and your 
experience will be a positive one.<br>
