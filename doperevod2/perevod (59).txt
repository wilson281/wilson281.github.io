Some payday loans companies allow their customers to borrow around $1000 if they pay it back according to their payment schedule. Payday loan customers need to know, however, that they will end up repaying the cash advance company a lot more than they borrowed because of the high interest that is added to the payday loan. 

A few of the payday loan companies do not loan out large amounts of money like this, however, and they stay with loans up to around $500. However, there are times that payday loan customers may need a larger amount so don't depend upon a certain payday loan company to loan you as much money as you need. You could end up being disappointed. 

Many people see a payday loans as their last resort because they have no other options for getting a loan. Many people say that payday loans should only be used if you are borrowing a small amount of money that the normal loan channels will not help you with. Many of the loan companies cannot loan less than $1000, but payday loan companies may see your $1000 loan as a large loan and add on a large interest rate as well. 

If you can find a loan company that will loan you $1000 then that is the best decision. This is because the loan company will most likely charge you a much lower interest rate than the payday loan company will, which will make the terms of your loan easier to meet.

Most payday loan companies charges from $10 to $20 dollars per every $100 that you borrow. You can also file for loan extension in case that you ca not pay on the due date. Notice that filing the extension, the payday loan company will charge the interest twice. First one, on the original due date and the second one, on the new due date if the extension is approved.
