Start Asking For Quotes

The quickest way to gather quotes is to work with a broker site. A broker partners with several financing companies to offer special deals. Enter your information and receive multiple offers. You can find some great offers in these spots.

If you have time, expand your search to include specific lenders. The more quotes you get, the more likely you are to find that great deal.

How To Get The Best Quotes

The best quotes are the ones that are accurate. They are only as good as the information you find them. So make sure the car loan quote is marked a refinance loan and you submit the right year and model of your car. Also, be specific with your credit score. If you don’t know, you can request it from a number of credit agencies.

The length of the refinance loan will also affect your costs. The shorter the loan, the more you will save in interest. A delay of two years will usually cost you a point or more. You can request quotes with different months to see the difference.

If you just want a general idea of rates, look on lender sites. They will list rates for excellent credit scores. Refinanced rates usually have their own category, but are usually close to used car loan rates.

Then send the forms back. After that, you are done and can start enjoying your savings.
