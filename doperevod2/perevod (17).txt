There could be many reasons for which you would like to apply for a payday loan. It could be because of an unexpected emergency, an unaccounted for expenditure, a medical bill, or maybe because your car broke down. At the same time, you could even apply for payday loans to fund a holiday or to buy a gift for someone special. In fact, a payday loan company does not take your credit history into consideration, so even if you have a bad credit history, you can apply for these loans, which is why they are also known as bad credit payday advance loans.

Payday loans are meant to help you to meet your unexpected financial demands and not to aggravate them. As a result, it is imperative to select the right loan. The right loan implies a loan that is available at the best possible rate. And in order to select the best rate, there are certain parameters and points that you should keep in mind.

Compare the annual percentage rate

Now, what could be the easiest way of comparing the rate that is being offered for payday loans by different companies? In fact, all payday loan companies have to disclose the annual percentage rate (APR) of a loan, before you sign the agreement. And this is a direction issued by the US Government and as a result all companies have to comply with it. As a consumer, you need to know that in most cases, a payday loan is paid back within a span of three weeks. As a result, the ARR can be used to compare different lenders but it does not tell you the actual cost of the loan. The advantage is that the APR has to include the interest rate as well as the fees. So when you select the lowest APR, you actually select the best rate available.

Finding out the finance fee

Another point that needs to be taken into consideration is the finance fee that is being charged by the payday loan lender. The finance fees can be in the form of interest rates or in terms of the flat fees. These fees vary from lender to lender. At the same time, in order to attract customers, a number of lenders waive off the finance fees if you are borrowing from them for the first time. So, make it a point to carry out a basic research before selecting the ideal payday loan.

Pay back on time

After you’ve found the ideal payday loan or bad credit payday advance and met your immediate cash needs, next comes paying back the loan. Ideally, you should try to pay back the loan on the due date. Just in case you cannot, it would mean that you might have to pay an extra fee. So to keep the loan economical, ideally it makes sense to plan in such a manner that you can payback the loan well in time. Try to be prompt in informing your lender and applying for an extension on the time limit to pay back loan just in case you are unable to pay back in time.
