Personal loans come in two forms: Secured and unsecured personal loans. Secured loans are guaranteed by the client with a personal asset such as a real estate or a vehicle. Unsecured loans on the other side don’t require any collateral. But, though you may say this is the only difference between the two kinds of loans, the truth is that this difference has many consequences.

Secured loans involve less risk for the lender and this turns into lower interest rates, longer repayment periods and lower monthly payments. As opposed, unsecured loans imply higher risks for the lending institution and thus carry higher interest rates, shorter repayment periods and higher monthly payments.

Knowing your credit report before applying for a loan is essential. Credit agencies are required to provide you with a free copy of your credit report as per your request, so don’t waste this opportunity. Demand your free copy and make sure there are no errors or inaccuracies and if you find something that needs to be corrected, act immediately and contact the credit agency. Credit Agencies are prepared to deal with this kind of problems and are required by law to attend at your request for revisions.

There are many people in the same situation and the financial industry, as creative as it is, has shaped solutions for people with bad credit, no credit at all or even for those who have gone through bankruptcy.

There are many lenders now offering personal loans for people with bad credit, the conditions are not as good as regular loans but they are a good way to rebuild your credit and a better source of finance than credit cards.
