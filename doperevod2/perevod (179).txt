Why Online Refinancing Is Better

Refinancing online gives you access to thousands of lenders from across the nation. With so many financing companies seeking out your business, companies have lowered their rates and fees. In some cases there are even additional rate drops for applying online.

Online mortgage brokers also make refi shopping a snap. By giving quotes from multiple companies, you save time. You can also sometimes get a better deal by working with a broker.

How To Get The Best Rates

To get the best rates on your refinancing, select optimal terms. A 15 year mortgage is almost a point less than a 30 year loan. Adjustable rate mortgages also have lower initial rates.

But by far, the greatest savings come from comparing loan estimates. Ask each lender for a quote on the refinance amount and terms you want. Keep the information the same when you request loan quotes from each lender so you have comparable numbers.

Remember too that if you decide you want different terms, you will need to ask for new quotes. One lender may have the best rates for a fixed rate $100,000 mortgage, but a different company has the best rates for an adjustable $50,000 mortgage.

Two Weeks To Refinance

From start to finish, it takes about two weeks to refinance your mortgage online. Submitting your information over a secure server means you can get your loan contract in a day or two. Once your final paperwork has been notarized and received by your lender, the funds transfer is completed.

Paperwork is kept to a minimum with an online application. You can also get a notary to meet you at home, work, or any place. With a cash out, your funds are wired to your account for convenience. All the while, you can rest easy knowing you got the best deal on your refi.
