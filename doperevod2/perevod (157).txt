These days there are payday loans and then there are quick payday loans and yes, there is a difference. Regular payday loans you either have to submit a check to be cashed on your next payday or have direct deposit, either way they can take up to 24-48 hours to get the money. With a quick payday loan you fill out all of the paperwork online and get the money within a couple of hours.

Most quick payday loans do not require that you fax in things such as paycheck stubs and bank statements. Usually these loan companies will accept much of this information online and then will call your bank or credit union directly for any information they need on your bank statement. These types of payday loans are quick and easy but you still need to beware of the down falls.

First off these quick payday loans are easy and quick, but they often don’t offer a lot of paperwork. If anything were to go wrong with your loan or your ability to pay the loan back, it is hard to contact the loan company. Also many of them are located in other states so just traveling to the main office is not an option. You are literally at the mercy of the internet on these loans.

Second the interest rates on these loans are exceptionally high due to the fact that they are quick payday loans. These loans are considered high risk loans so companies can justify the higher interest rates. The bottom line is that there is a high demand for them so the companies can demand higher interest. It really is about supply and demand when it comes to quick payday loans.

So before you go and try out a quick payday loan do some research. If you can afford to wait 24-48 for a payday loan, then do that. If you can't, then at least be prepared for a higher interest rate for the convenience of receiving fast cash.
