More than often, I’ve heard my mother say … “It’s only the 28th. I still have to get through another 3 days before “D” day – Payday.” Well, a low bank balance towards the end of the month is not a familial complaint, but one that haunts every second person in every household. Working the entire month and looking forward to a paycheque is a regular feature. But the ironic part is that after waiting so eagerly, the sooner it comes in … the sooner it’s out! At the beginning of a month, we all have certain obligations to fulfil, like gas and store bills, credit card dues, tuition fees, loan repayments, medical and grocery necessities, etc. The list can go on, while the resources are limited. After clearing all our monthly dues, our bank account holds a minimal balance. Now, what if an emergency arises, especially towards the month end? Solution: “Say hello to Payday Loans!”
