For a small business owner, it is never easy to secure a business loan, either for working capital or for starting a new business, as most lenders consider them risky investment.

It worsens when such borrowers—small business owners—go for funding unprepared. My endeavor through this series of articles is to make small business owners aware of some crucial aspects of funding process.

Whether you're planning to launch a startup or want to expand your business, you are going to need money. Debt and equity financing are two different financial strategies you can opt for. Incurring debt entails borrowing money for your business, whereas gaining equity means injecting your own or other stakeholders’ cash into your company.

<b>Debt Financing</b>

Quite a few business owners are reluctant about borrowing from a financial institution, as it means cut in cash profits. But it could be a good option so long as you have sufficient cash flow to pay back the loans, plus interest.

<b>Equity Financing</b>

Small business owners often opt for equity financing because they are not sure about qualifying for a loan, or they don’t want to part with cash profits to service the repayment. Investors and partners can provide equity financing.

<b>Advantages of debt financing: </b>

•	You do not have to part with any ownership or future profits of your business. Your lender has no control in how you run your business.
•	You can keep your business profits in the company, and enhance the long term value, or use those profits to pay a return to the owners of the company.
•	You can avail tax deduction on interest paid.

<b>Disadvantages of debt financing: </b>

•	You have to maintain sufficient cash flow to repay the loans. 
•	You will be using your cash profits to pay back the loans. You may earn profit but there won’t be cash to show for it. 
•	The riskier the loan is, the higher the interest rate will be. 
•	You might have to furnish some sort of guarantee as owner of the business. 
•	Lender has rights to seize your collateral, in case of non repayment. 
•	Too much debt might affect your credit rating and your ability to raise money in the future.

<b>Advantages of equity financing: </b>

•	Equity contributions do not have to be paid back even if your company goes bankrupt. 
•	Your business assets do not have to be pledged as collateral to obtain equity investments. 
•	Businesses with sufficient equity will look better to lenders, investors and the IRS. 
•	Your business will have more cash available because it will not have to make debt payments.

<b>Disadvantages of equity financing: </b>

•	You will have to part with some of the ownership stake, and your business’s profits will be shared by other equity investors. 
•	You might have to contend with different ideas on how to run the business. 
•	No tax deduction on dividend payments.

Most businesses have a mix of debt and equity financing. Too little equity could prevent you from securing or repaying loans, while carrying little or no debt could indicate that you are too risk-averse, and that your business might not grow as a result.

<b>Business Cash Advance, a Good Alternative: </b>

But is there any alternative to loans so far as the small businesses are concerned? Yes, there are many other companies that are offering business cash advance to small business owners.

Business cash advance is not a loan and the organization offering this cash advance gets their money from the credit card sales that the business does in a specific period, there by reducing the burden of paying back the loan and the terms and conditions to qualify for such cash advance are also relatively simple.

There are quite a few organizations which provide such cash advances. Organizations like <b>MerchantCashDirect</b> usually provides cash advance for working capital needs. They more often than not, target specific industries. To expand the example of above mentioned organization: They seek to provide funds to people into restaurant, retail or service industry processing at least $4000 in credit card receipts per month.

I hope that I helped clear some doubts and given some useful information through my articles. If information is power, you are now empowered to succeed in your endeavor to secure loan, there by realize your dreams.
