To find the quickest payday loans, you need to look for fast loan processing. Time delays occur in the type of processes cash advance companies use, such as faxing paperwork.

Online Applications

Online applications are the quickest way to apply for a payday loan. You save time traveling and waiting in line. And if you need to find financial records to verify information, you can find them right there in your house.

To find the truly fastest application, look for ones that require no faxing of documents. If a cash advance company requires forms, a person will have to review those documents, which takes time. 

Instead choose a lender who promises approval within minutes. These types of lenders have created an application process that uses databases to check information and then generate an automated response. 

Few Requirements

For a truly fast loan process, find a lender with few requirements. At a minimum you will need to be 18 years of age, have a monthly income, and a checking account. 

Additional requirements, like four months of employment history or a telephone conference call, only add time to the process. If your intent is to simply to find fast cash, then skip these types of lenders. However, be aware you may be forfeiting low rates and fees. 

Direct Deposit

Direct deposit ensures that you will have your money quickly. For fast money, look for a lender who transfers funds within hours of approval, typically over night. Some lenders will only process money during business days, which can be a problem if you apply on the weekend. Usually larger companies have weekend staff to process requests for funds. 

Automatic Withdrawals 

While you may be only thinking about getting money fast, also look for a payday loan company that can make your payments easy. Most lenders will automatically withdraw your payment on your next payday. It saves you a stamp and a check. You can arrange to pay part or all of the loan amount.
