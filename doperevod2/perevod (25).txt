December to January is the longest period of the year between pay days. Add to that the increased spending over the Christmas shopping season and many people find themselves short of cash in January. Unfortunately Santa Claus does not bring the gift of reduced liabilities and bills in January, but often these bills are even greater.

To avoid falling behind in your commitments, and to maintain your credit score and credit rating, a Payday Loan or Payday Cash Advance may provide the perfect solution. If you are in need of extra cash until your next pay day, you may want to consider applying for a payday loan or cash advance online.

A Payday Loan can be obtained online with no credit check. If you have a bad credit record, this will not disqualify you from obtaining a Payday Loan. The loan proceeds can often be deposited into your checking account the same day as you apply. All you need to qualify is a checking account and a regular source of income, and you can qualify for up to $1000 or more to be deposited directly into your checking account.

Although you can use a pay day loan for any purpose, it is mainly designed to help with your short-term financial needs, and because of the cost of borrowing with a pay day loan, they should not be used as a source of regular lending. The finance costs of Payday Loans are usually higher than a traditional bank loan and should therefore only be used to cover short term financial commitments.

If you do not use the money you get from a Payday Loan carefully, then you could end up in an even worse financial mess. If you are applying for a pay day cash advance to help you pay bills, and you don't pay them, then you will not only be in debt to the Payday Loan company, but you will also still have the original bill you needed to pay.

Payday Loan interest rates vary from company to company. Some lenders will even offer discounted rates for new or returning customers. So it can pay to shop around for the best rates, and comparing pay day cash advance loans online can provide an easy solution to this.

If used correctly, the costs of obtaining a Payday Loan can be worth it to provide you with the cash to keep your existing commitments up to date, and prevent damage to your credit record. The pay day cash advance loan costs may prove to be less than the alternative costs of bad credit repair.

After supplying the Payday Loan company with the required information - usually just your name, address, banking and employment details - you can be approved for a pay day cash advance in as little as one hour and have the money deposited into your checking account the same day. Occasionally you may be required to fax the company your last pay check stub and bank statement prior to approval, but you can still have the funds deposited straight into your checking account the same day. Many online Payday Loan companies no longer require you to fax documents for approval, and you can apply and be approved quickly 24/7. Applying and getting approved is quick and convenient.

A bad credit record should not prevent you from applying for a payday cash advance loan, as there is no credit check performed, and only verification of the information you supply to the Payday Loan Company. Payday loan companies do not check your credit report and in fact the ability to maintain your commitments using the proceeds of a pay day cash advance may actually help to improve or repair your credit report rating, and will certainly prevent any further damage to your credit report.

If you find yourself in the short-term post Christmas cash wilderness, consider an online Payday Loan to assist you until your next pay check arrives.
