Does the sound familiar?  "I sure could use a few extra dollars to get me through to my next paycheck, but nobody gives our small loans!"  Or maybe you've heard this one before, "Sure, banks will loan you money - if you have perfect credit and don't need it.  Nobody cares about the working class person anymore!"

Does the sound familiar?  "I sure could use a few extra dollars to get me through to my next paycheck, but nobody gives our small loans!"  Or maybe you've heard this one before, "Sure, banks will loan you money - if you have perfect credit and don't need it.  Nobody cares about the working class person anymore!"

Truth be told, those two statements used to be 100% correct.  Nobody cared about the working person and no financial institution wanted to deal with small loans that made them no profit.  The good news is that times have changed and thanks to the payday loan industry there is now an entire sector of the financial services market that is looking out for the working class!

A payday loan works like this.  Say you need money for an unexpected expense, but payday is weeks away.  You can take out a small loan (typically under $2000) and pay it back either in one payment or over a series of installments.  And here is the best part:  Almost everyone qualifies!

You see, unlike most other lenders, payday loan companies understand that the working man and woman doesn't have a credit report that is full of nothing but good news most of the time.  They know that the definition of "working" doesn't mean having a suitcase full of extra money just lying around!  They want to help the 99% of us who have to get up in the morning and go to work.
Basically, if you have a job, you qualify!  It's pretty much that simple.  A very short loan application and you are done.  There isn't even a credit check!  As long as they can verify your employment then the cash is yours.  Talk about easy and convenient.

Some of you may be a bit uneasy about taking out a payday loan.  Perhaps you are worried that it will be seen as a sign of weakness in your character to have to take out something such as this.  Well, take my advice and throw those thoughts in the trash!  Today's payday loan industry has made everything secure, private and electronic.  You can apply for and receive your payday loan from the comfort of your own house over the Internet.  A few clicks of the mouse and you are on your way to taking care of your financial emergency and getting your life back on track.

Many payday loan lenders are competitive - they want your business and they go after it by offering competitive loan rates and even free "first time" loans.  Some will even wave payments or offer other incentives to earn your business and trust.  You won't find a bank giving you anything for free!

So stop worrying about how you are going to pay for the dentist to fix that cavity that appeared out of nowhere.  Don't fret over the fact that your clothes dryer just ate your best pair of slacks.  Instead, read up on how the payday loan industry has changed in the past few years and find out how they can help you take care of your small emergency.  You may be surprised to find out how easy and convenient their services can be.
