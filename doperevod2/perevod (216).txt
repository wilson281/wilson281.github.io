A payday loan (also written as paydayloan) is basically meant to help you out in the case of an emergency. In the recent years with the easy availability of these loans and the convenience that they offer, their popularity has soared. At the same time, though people recognize the advantages of these payday loans (also written as paydayloans), they do not have any knowledge about the laws that regulate the functioning of this industry. When you plan to apply for a payday loan ideally you should know your rights so that you are not duped by the lender. 

Laws, Rules and Regulations

A payday loan company has to abide by federal as well as state laws. The state laws help in determining the amount that you can borrow and it also dictates the repayment period. In certain states their might also be a number of other laws that are applicable to payday loans. The lender should be able to provide information on these and if he refuses to do so, then you need to be extra cautious in your dealings. A lot of information about the laws, rules and regulations regarding payday loans is now available online, so take out a little time to carry out some research on your own. 

The Right to Information

As a consumer, as is the case while buying any other product, you have the right to information. This implies that the lender has to inform you about all the costs involved in getting a payday loan. This implies that you need to be told the exact interest rate, the finance fees and the transaction costs if any, and also the extra charges that you would need to pay in case you need an extension. Also, before you take a payday advance, make sure that you know the exact payment plan. In most cases payday loan lenders offer this information on their website. In case this information is not available on the website, you can either send an email to them or call them up to find out the requisite details. This information should also be mentioned in the loan agreement.

Canceling a Payday Loan

Now, there are times when you apply for a payday loan but then later on realize that you do not need it. In certain states, there is a provision to cancel the payday loan within a day without any cost. But then again, before taking such a decision, find out if the rule is applicable in your state or not. In case it is, then you would need to give a written application to the lender in order to cancel the loan. Also, if the advance has already been deposited into your account, then you would have to pay that back immediately as per the instructions of the lender that have to be in compliance with the applicable laws. Also, when you cancel a payday loan, make sure that you take a receipt from the lender that the amount has been paid back. At the same time, it ideally makes more sense to consider your decision to take a loan and determine if you really need it before applying for a loan.
