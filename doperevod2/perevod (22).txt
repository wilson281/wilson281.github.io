For some people, the idea of getting a payday loan is still a strange prospect – it might even be a little scary. With some of the news stories about instant loans circulating the media, warning consumers about the pitfalls of fast cash advances, applying for one may not seem like a good plan if you find yourself in a financial bind.

But in many instances, a payday loan can be an excellent way to obtain cash quickly, especially in an emergency situation. Not everything in life is planned – you may suddenly have to pay a large car repair bill, or any other unexpected expense. If you don’t own a credit card, or have already maxed it out, and don’t want to burden friends or family with a request for money, the only option you really have left is an overnight cash advance.

A payday loan is a small short-term loan (usually in the amount of $100-$1500) that has a high interest rate. It allows you to access cash, usually overnight, before your next payday, which is much faster than a traditional loan from a bank. And it’s easier to be approved for cash advance loans – you can even apply for one online. You don’t have to go through a credit check, the process is discreet, and the transaction is secure. And if you have no credit, or bad credit, this won’t affect your ability to obtain a payday loan. It’s no wonder payday loans are growing in popularity.

Although you have to pay a fee to take out a cash advance, in some circumstances getting your hands on much needed funds, almost instantly, is worthwhile, as long as you know your next paycheck will be able to cover the loan right away.

Of course, just like with any other loan, it’s important to realize that you should only apply for a payday loan if you plan to pay it back with your next paycheck. That is the purpose of a “payday” loan – to advance you the money you need before you get paid. Don’t go into the process with the intention of renewing the loan.

Most of the controversy surrounding payday loans is entirely unwarranted. Ultimately, a payday loan company provides a service that is needed in the community, and when used responsibly for its intended purposes, it can really help people get out of sticky situations.

If you plan on getting a cash advance, just follow a simple rule to avoid running into unwanted problems: apply for one from a reputable company that won’t gouge you for all you have (or don’t have). If you take advantage of a cash advance loan, pay the loan back by your next payday, so more interest charges won’t accumulate.

Payday loans can be an effective way to access cash quickly, at times when you need it most. As long as you plan to use the service the way it’s meant to be, and avoid companies that don’t cater well to their customer’s needs, it might just be the best thing for you.
