Here's how it works.  Let's say you have an unexpected expense.  Maybe the washing machine decided to die in the middle of the rinse cycle or your oven decided it was tired of all the hot air.  Whatever the reason, you need money fast.  This is where the payday and cash advance loan industry comes into play.  They are there to lend you the money you need for a short period of time, typically between 7 and 30 days.  They make small loans, anywhere from $100 - $2000 dollars in most places, and are flexible in their repayment terms.  


Modern cash advance services have put the customer first and you will find that you can complete much of your business from the comfort of your own house - how's that for privacy!  Typically, many lenders nowadays have online sites where you can fill out the short loan application, tell them where to deposit the money and give them information on what repayment terms you would like.  Usually within 24 hours the money is deposited straight into your account and nobody knows but you!  
The payday loan industry has been one of the leaders in making sure that data is secure and safe.  If you are getting a loan online, or in person, you can rest assured that they are using some of the most advanced data protection policies in the marketplace today.  Most lenders pride themselves in the fact that they are audited as often as every day to test their data privacy standards on their websites and in their offices.


Cash advance lenders also realize that when you need money you usually need it fast.  That is why they can in most cases have your money to you within 24 hours electronically, or in some cases offer the ability for you to stop by your local office and pick up the cash once you have filled out the paperwork online.  By offering this flexibility they are ensuring that when an emergency strikes you aren't left out in the cold waiting for days - as is typical with some banks - for a decision or the money.


The payday and cash advance loan industry of today is far different from what you knew of in the past.  They have changed their businesses to compete head on with banks in many areas.  By offering innovative solutions for life's problems they have brought back dignity to the industry and are helping hundreds of thousands of people each month.
