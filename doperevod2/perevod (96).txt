You were shocked when your application for personal loan was rejected. You had always used a particular bank for all your finance related requirements. But this time you decided to access another bank to finance the personal loan requirement and had to face the refusal. 

The refusal is not an issue enough to be worried for. Since different lenders employ different methods to calculate the credit score of borrowers, the disparity in approach is obvious. The lender you have been using ever since was assured of your credibility because of regular transactions. The same may not apply to loan providers who are dealing with you for the first time. 

For any loan transaction, the loan provider would first approach a credit reference agency to determine the credibility of the would-be borrower. Credit report is verified in order to find details about the credit dealings of an individual. Did you know that the credit report might have added many positive as well as negative features since the time you last viewed it? Many of the additions are too trivial to be taken note of. Some, on the other hand, appear erroneously on the credit report. 

Whatever be the reason for the items appearing on the credit report, these do have an effect on the terms offered to the borrower. Therefore, one planning to take up a personal loan must start by looking at ones credit report. The credit reference agencies are ever ready to make changes to the discrepancies that might have appeared in the credit report. Good credit history is a prerequisite to a better deal.

Personal Loans, as the name suggests, are used by individuals to their personal requirements. The uses range from debt consolidation to home improvement. Smaller as well as large-sized expenses are to be made through the personal loan proceeds. The amount that is available on the personal loans is not restricted. There are several factors that determine the loan proceeds that a borrower can avail. Principal among them is the value of collateral. More is the value of collateral; more will the borrower command of the loan provider. In practice, personal loan amount ranges from £3000 to £100,000.

One method of classifying personal loans in the UK is into secured and unsecured personal loans. Though secured loans are thought to differ from the unsecured loans only in terms of collateral, many more differences arise subsequently. A secured loan is one where the borrower has to back the repayments with a lien on certain asset/assets. This is considered a safer option to lend. There are lesser chances of the amount lent becoming irrecoverable. The loan provider does not have to demand settlement of his debt; instead he sells off the assets to recover his debt.

Unsecured personal loans, on the other hand, have to look up at the borrower for loan settlement. These do not allow loan provider direct charge on the borrower’s assets. The unsecured debts have a secondary charge; i.e. only after something is left after paying off the secured debts, the unsecured debts will be paid. Accordingly, there is no guarantee of receiving back the entire amount lent. Insecurity of the loan providers will be visible in the terms offered. Interest rates will be lower on a secured loan as compared to unsecured loans. There is a vast difference between the APRs on the two forms of personal loans.

Online personal loan is a relatively newer concept in the lending market. Through this technique borrowers can apply for personal loans from any place round the clock. For instance, individuals can apply for personal loans in the UK during their journey to the Hawaiian Islands. All they need is an Internet connection that transfers their loan details to the loan providers. Loan providers undertake to provide maximum security to the applicants’ details. Borrowers must check for the protection clause in the terms and conditions of the loan provider. Loan providers must ensure security of application details under the Data Protection Act of 1998.

Personal loans form the easiest method of drawing money for individual financial needs. The cost of drawing the personal loans will always be manageable, provided important aspects of the personal loan are decided with sufficient prudence. Loan providers are open to negotiations to make your personal loans more befitting your individual financial condition.
